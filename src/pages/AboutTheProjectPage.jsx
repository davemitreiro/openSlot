        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Project History</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for <strong>openSlot</strong> came about while helping a
          freelancing friend who struggled with the manual process of booking
          appointments. Witnessing the frustration of managing appointments
          manually led to the vision of creating an easy-to-use platform that
          automates this task. Development began in August 2024, with key
          milestones being the completion of the appointment system and calendar
          integration.
